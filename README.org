* PangVim
** An Ultimate (Neo)Vim configuration.
   - This is a (Neo)Vim configuration referred to ThinkVim, Spacemacs, and David Chen's Neovim configuration.
   - I must say that I'm grateful to ThinkVim and David Chen, their configuration files are so impressed that I learn a lot from them.

** Requirements
    - ~nodejs~
      You need to do this to install requirements.
    #+begin_src shell
    npm install -g neovim
    #+end_src
    - ~yarn~
    - ~pynvim~
       You can install by running this in your terminal
    #+begin_src shell
    pip install pynvim
    #+end_src

    
** Installation
   Before you start to install, please make sure you have NeoVim first(Some of my plugins
are NeoVim only).
#+begin_src shell
git clone https://github.com/chunjieshan/pangvim ~/.config/nvim
#+end_src
